// We want to approximate the sqrt function. Usually this functions takes a floating point number and returns another floating point number, but in this kata we're going to work with integral numbers instead.
//
// Your task is to write a function that takes an integer n and returns either
//
// an integer k if n is a square number, such that k * k == n or
// a range (k, k+1), such that k * k < n and n < (k+1) * (k+1).
